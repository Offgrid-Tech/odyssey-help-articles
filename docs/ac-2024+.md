## Overview

The air conditioner uses three sources of power.

1. The main control panel (thermostat/4 switch) uses 12VDC.
2. ModeCOM uses 58VDC
3. Air conditioner unit uses 120VAC (blower/compressor).

## Troubleshooting

1. is the inverter on? (Verify LEDs on front of inverter through access cover).
2. Check the 120VAC breaker located on the passenger side garage, located in the black access panel, labeled "A/C" (figure 1).
3. Try a full M-Power System power down and let rest for minute to allow the power distribution modules (PDM) to reset. Power back up.
4. Is thermostat set to cool/auto and desired temperature set lower than ambient temperature?
5. Is there ice formed on the coils under the roof shroud? If so, shut A/C down and let thaw. Ice will not allow for heat dissapation and impede A/C function.
6. When removing the shroud, if you find oily residue, its likely due to a refridgerant leak or compressor failure.
7. If problem persist, contact Storyteller.

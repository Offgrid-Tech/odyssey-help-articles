# Volta

## Push button colors

| Color                        | Description                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Green                        | System on                     |
| Green (flashing)             | Charge only mode [^button-1]  |
| Yellow                       | Too cold to charge            |
| Yellow (flashing, 5 sec)     | Starting                      |
| Dim yellow (flashing, 5 sec) | Shutting down                 |
| Yellow (flashing, 30 sec)    | System fault causing shutdown |

[^button-1]: Charge only mode: System is off but charging, will shutdown once power is removed.

## Important pack temperatures

| Temp (F) | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 134.6    | System shutdown (high temperature)         |
| 131      | High temperature warning                   |
| 125.6    | High temperature recovery [^temp-1]        |
| 116.6    | Too hot to charge, pack power still usable |
| 59       | heating pads turn off (if they were on)    |
| 42.8     | Charging resumes (if system was too cold)  |
| 37.8     | System too cold to charge                  |
| -4       | System shutdown (too cold)                 |

[^temp-1]: If shutdown due to heat, pack will power up when below this temperature.

## Volta LCD System Indicators

| Indicator                                                        | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![volta-indicator](images/volta-system-indicator-alternator.png) | Alternator Charging: Flex Pack is ready for charging from alternator, or is currently charging from alternator. |
| ![volta-indicator](images/volta-system-indicator-cold.png)       | Flex Pack Temperature Low: Flex Pack too cold to charge.                                                        |
| ![volta-indicator](images/volta-system-indicator-heating.png)    | Heating Pads On: Heating pads are on and actively warming Flex Pack.                                            |
| ![volta-indicator](images/volta-system-indicator-hot.png)        | Pack Temperature High: Flex Pack is at or near high temperature shutdown limit.                                 |
| ![volta-indicator](images/volta-system-indicator-fault.png)      | System Fault: System fault is active. Refer to the Alerts screen for details.                                   |

### Fault States

| LED Color       | LED State | Operationg Conditions                           |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| None            | Off       | No power to unit or internal fault              |
| Amber           | Solid     | Low battery 0-5 seconds (Warning)               |
| Red             | Solid     | Overload 0-5 seconds (Warning)                  |
| Red             | 1 blink   | Inverter Low Battery shut down [^fault-2]       |

| Red             | 9 blinks  | Input DC Transient Clamp                        |
| Green-Amber-Red | --        | Reverse Polarity Detected [^fault-3]            |

[^fault-1]: Faults will self recover when conditions return to normal range.
[^fault-2]: Faults may be due to a short-circuited output or low or weak DC voltage source.
[^fault-3]: The inverter/charger must be sent back to the factory for evaluation.

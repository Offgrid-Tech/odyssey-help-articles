# Cabin lights not working

## 2021 and older

If pressing the touch switch does not turn off overhead lights, remove the fuse labeled "Cabin Lights" located in the 12VDC fuse panel. Refer to the fuse diagram on the access panel (see figures below).

## 2021 and newer

Try turning off lights via ModeCOM screen. If not successful try resetting the Volta.

If the cabin touch lightswitch is bad, you can swap out the awning lightswitch, but it must be rewired since the wiring config is slightly different. A swap procedure can be found in the tips/tricks here.

Contact Storyteller for further assistance on replacements.

## Troubleshooting

1. Try turning off lights via ModeCOM screen.
2. Perform a full power down for 2 minutes, power back up.
3. If the cabin touch lightswitch is bad, you can swap out the awning lightswitch, but it must be rewired since the wiring config is slightly different. A swap procedure can be found in the tips/tricks here.
4. Contact Storyteller for further assistance on replacements.

## A single 12VDC thing doesn't work

Have a typical 12VDC fuse box located behind an access cover on the volta cabinet. Refer to your owners manual/fuse diagram for applicable fuses.

## No 12VDC things work

Powered by 2 Victron DC to DC converters. These converters are fed from the Volta 58VDC distribution block via a small fused distribution block located under the solar charge controller and the other fuse is for the 12VDC converters. Easiest method to check is to do a DC voltage measurement (~58VDC) at terminal of the small distribution block. If you are missing voltage at one of the smaller terminals, that adjacent fuse is bad. These are interchangable, so you can use the other if needed to restore the converter input power. If the 12VDC power system is not working, it will affect turning on the inverter. The inverter is remotely powered up via a 58VDC turn on signal, via a relay enabled by a 12VDC signal.

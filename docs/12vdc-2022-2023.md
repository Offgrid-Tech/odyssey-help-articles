## A single 12VDC thing doesn't work

Use PDMs (Power Distribution Modules). To reset them, power down system for 1 minute and power back up. You can view PDM status on the diagnostics screen on ModeCOM.

## No 12VDC things work

Powered by a Lynx distribution box (blue box with a bunch of wires). If you suspect power issues to the 12V system, check fuses in the distribution box.

> The smaller red wires are the inputs to the converters and charge controller. The larger cable is the volta power feed to the distro block.

These fuses are available at auto part stores.

1. If pressing the touch switch does not turn off awning lights, remove the fuse labeled "Awning" located in the 12VDC fuse panel (figure 1). Refer to the fuse diagram on the access panel (figure 2). If lights are needed, reinstall fuse.
   - Lighting fuse may be different from the "awning" fuse! It may be the "Cargo/upper light fuse". In this case, the awning can still be deployed/restracted, just no lights.
2. If awning touch lightswitch is bad, you can swap it out with the cabin lightswitch, but it must be rewired since the wiring config is slightly different. Swap procedure can be found here.
3. Contact Storyteller for further assistance on replacements.

# Sink won't drain

First check the following:

- Is the grey tank full?
- Is the sink drain screen installed?

## Troubleshooting

Press the sink drain button. Does the macerator cycle? If it does not cycle, try shutting down volta for 2 minutes then power back up and try again.

If the sink still won't drain, try the following:

1. Remove the sink cabinet drawers and locate the sink drain bladder which is located inside with a white fitting.
2. Inside is the bladder which prevents gas coming through the sink drain. These can get inverted or stick together and prevent water passage.
3. Drain the sink as much as you can and have a container/towels to catch water when removing. Remove the white bladder pipe behind the drawers.
4. Make sure it's not rolled, pinched, or stuck. Use your finger or something that won't puncture the material to free it. Reinstall the bladder and try again.

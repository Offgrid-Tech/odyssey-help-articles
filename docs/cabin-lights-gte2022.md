# Cabin lights not working

Try turning off lights via ModeCOM screen. If not successful try resetting the Volta.

If the cabin touch lightswitch is bad, you can swap out the awning lightswitch, but it must be rewired since the wiring config is slightly different. A swap procedure can be found in the tips/tricks here.

Contact Storyteller for further assistance on replacements.
